Q1:Modify it to show the matchid and player name for all goals scored by Germany. To identify German players, check for: teamid = 'GER'
A1:
SELECT game.id,goal.player FROM game,goal
where game.id = goal.matchid and goal.teamid = 'GER' 

Q2:From the previous query you can see that Lars Bender's scored a goal in game 1012. Now we want to know what teams were playing in that match.

Notice that the matchid column in the goal table corresponds to the id column in the game table. We can look up information about game 1012 by finding that row in the game table.

Show id, stadium, team1, team2 for just game 1012

A2:
SELECT id,stadium,team1,team2
  FROM game where id = 1012

Q3:You can combine the two steps into a single query with a JOIN.

SELECT *
  FROM game JOIN goal ON (id=matchid)
The FROM clause says to merge data from the goal table with that from the game table. The ON says how to figure out which rows in game go with which rows in goal - the matchid from goal must match id from game. (If we wanted to be more clear/specific we could say
ON (game.id=goal.matchid)

The code below shows the player (from the goal) and stadium name (from the game table) for every goal scored.

Modify it to show the player, teamid, stadium and mdate for every German goal.

A3:
SELECT player,teamid,stadium,mdate
  FROM game JOIN goal ON (id=matchid)
where goal.teamid = 'GER'
