Q1:Modify it to show the matchid and player name for all goals scored by Germany. To identify German players, check for: teamid = 'GER'
A1:
SELECT game.id,goal.player FROM game,goal
where game.id = goal.matchid and goal.teamid = 'GER' 

Q2:From the previous query you can see that Lars Bender's scored a goal in game 1012. Now we want to know what teams were playing in that match.

Notice that the matchid column in the goal table corresponds to the id column in the game table. We can look up information about game 1012 by finding that row in the game table.

Show id, stadium, team1, team2 for just game 1012

A2:
SELECT id,stadium,team1,team2
  FROM game where id = 1012

Q3:You can combine the two steps into a single query with a JOIN.

SELECT *
  FROM game JOIN goal ON (id=matchid)
The FROM clause says to merge data from the goal table with that from the game table. The ON says how to figure out which rows in game go with which rows in goal - the matchid from goal must match id from game. (If we wanted to be more clear/specific we could say
ON (game.id=goal.matchid)

The code below shows the player (from the goal) and stadium name (from the game table) for every goal scored.

Modify it to show the player, teamid, stadium and mdate for every German goal.

A3:
SELECT player,teamid,stadium,mdate
  FROM game JOIN goal ON (id=matchid)
where goal.teamid = 'GER'

Q4:Show the team1, team2 and player for every goal scored by a player called Mario player LIKE 'Mario%'
A4:
select team1,team2,player
from game JOIN goal
ON(id=matchid)
where player like 'Mario%'

Q5:Show player, teamid, coach, gtime for all goals scored in the first 10 minutes gtime<=10
A5:
SELECT player, teamid,coach, gtime
  FROM goal JOIN eteam 
   ON(teamid = id)
 WHERE gtime<=10

Q6:List the dates of the matches and the name of the team in which 'Fernando Santos' was the team1 coach.
A6:
select mdate,teamname
  from game join eteam
   on(team1 = eteam.id)
where coach = 'Fernando Santos'

Q7:List the player for every goal scored in a game where the stadium was 'National Stadium, Warsaw'
A7:
select player 
from goal join game
on(id = matchid)
where stadium = 'National Stadium, Warsaw'

Q8:Instead show the name of all players who scored a goal against Germany.
A8:
select distinct player 
from game join goal
on(id=matchid)
where (team1!= 'Ger' and team2= 'Ger' and teamid != 'Ger') or (team2!= 'Ger' and team1= 'Ger' and teamid != 'Ger') 

Q9:Show teamname and the total number of goals scored.
A9:
select stadium,count(matchid) goals
from game join goal
on(id = matchid)
group by stadium

Q10:Show the stadium and the number of goals scored in each stadium.
A10:
select stadium,count(matchid) goals
from game join goal
on(id = matchid)
group by stadium

Q11:For every match involving 'POL', show the matchid, date and the number of goals scored.
A11:
SELECT matchid,mdate, count(matchid)
  FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id 
 WHERE (team1 = 'POL' OR team2 = 'POL')
group by matchid,mdate

Q12:For every match where 'GER' scored, show matchid, match date and the number of goals scored by 'GER'
A12:
select matchid,mdate, count(matchid)
from game join goal
on(id=matchid)
where teamid = 'Ger'
group by matchid, mdate

Q13:List every match with the goals scored by each team as shown. This will use "CASE WHEN" which has not been explained in any previous exercises.
A13:

select mdate,team1,
   sum(case when teamid=team1 then 1 else 0 end) score1,
   team2,
   sum(case when teamid=team2 then 1 else 0 end) score2
from game join goal on matchid = id
group by mdate,team1,team2
order by mdate,team1,team2
